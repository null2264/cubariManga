# `Cubari Manga`

## Archived: This was made as an alternative source to MangaDex for me to use in Tachiyomi back when their website is dead and undergoing rewrite phase. Now that it's back online, I don't see a reason to keep this repo up.

Plan:
- Log/cache already scraped page/chapter to reduce unnecessary requests
- **caek.co.py**: Automatically save a temporary json file
- Updater bot connected with an app (like telegram, discord or custom app for android) [**Maybe ?**]
- **scraper**: Automatically download chapter pages and upload to imgur
- Automatically parse imgur as a chapter
